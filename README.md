# My Linux

## Distibution
 ### Current
 - Ubuntu Budgie - Ubuntu for apt, Budgie for appearance.
 ### Favorites
 - Solus (waiting for v4 release in Jan/2017) - love Budgie DE, Ikey is a cool dude, different kind of rolling release, has nice look and feel. On the other hand, I had some trouble with eopkg and installing software in general, installing Android Studio was a hassle with 32bit package dependencies and even caused / partition to appear out of space while it was not (yes I checked inodes). Also, because of my misunderstanding of what `eopkg autoremove` does, I deleted a good bunch of my system, not quite `rm -rf /` , but after that I got pissed with Solus and went to Bungie flavored Ubuntu for the time being.
 - BunsenLabs (CrunchBang continuation) - was amazing for my offensively old laptop
 ### Didn't stick
 - Arch, Manjaro, Antergos - too much hassle for my personal liking. Learned from them a lot, Manjaro even ran for 3 month without a single error once upon a time, but I still lack the knowledge to quickly and effortlessly fix problems that inevitably come up with a rolling release model. Though, pacman and yaourt are super lovely.

## Desktop Environment
- Bungie
- Openbox for dying machines
- Xfce if all else fails
KDE and Gnome are too hungry for my 2013 laptop. And Gnome just looks bad to me, while KDE = terrible defaults, complicated settings.

## Terminal
* Terminator
* (Possibly) Tilix
  - if becomes dragable (doesn't allow resize in quake mode on all DEs)
## Code Editor
* Visual Studio Code
  ### Plugins
  - Settings Sync
  
  
  .bashrc, .dircolors
